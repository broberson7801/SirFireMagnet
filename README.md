This is the first third of a side project where a Paladin and a Red Dragon fight it out using AD&D 2nd Edition rules. Currently, only the Red Dragon has been implemented. The dragon's age categories, hit point spread, and the various ways the dragon can bring the pain accurately reflects the 2nd Edition Monster Manual. Each dragon is unique in that each dragon (regardless of age), generates randomly. Additionally, the dragon's name randomly comes from a pre-stored array of names. 

Future updates to this program (as time allows) will see the Paladin (along with associated abilities)  implemented, as well as spells, the "battle logic" and possibly a different type of dragon or monster.
